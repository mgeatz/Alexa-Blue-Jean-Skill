# Changelog for AWS SDK for JavaScript
<!--LATEST=2.4.14-->
<!--ENTRYINSERT-->

## 2.4.14
* feature: CloudFront: Amazon CloudFront now supports tagging for Web and Streaming distributions. Tags make it easier for you to allocate costs and optimize spending by categorizing and grouping AWS resources.
* feature: ECR: Adds filtering of ListImages requests based on whether an image is tagged or untagged.
* feature: MarketplaceCommerceAnalytics: Adds the `startSupportDataExport` operation.

## 2.4.13

* feature: AutoScaling: CORS support added. Now a default service in the browser build of the JavaScript SDK.
* feature: CodeDeploy: CORS support added. Now a default service in the browser build of the JavaScript SDK.
* feature: GameLift: Provides a new Search API for GameLift, which allows game developers to retrieve filtered and sorted lists of their GameSessions.
* feature: RDS: You can now use the AWS Management Console to easily move your DB instance to a different VPC, or to a different subnet group in the same VPC. For more information, see Updating the VPC for a DB Instance. If your DB instance is not in a VPC, you can now use the AWS Management Console to easily move your DB instance into a VPC. You can now copy the source files from a MySQL database to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket, and then restore an Amazon Aurora DB cluster from those files. This option can be considerably faster than migrating data using mysqldump.

## 2.4.12
* bugfix: Request: Adds a content-length check for the stream returned from `createReadStream()`, and the stream will emit an error when the bytes received are fewer than specified by the response content-length header.
* bugfix: S3: Reverts behavior introduced in version `2.4.0` of the SDK to default the `signatureVersion` of S3 clients to `v4`. S3 clients instantiated without a user-defined `signatureVersion` will now default to `v2` unless the region only supports `v4` signing. This change is being made due to issues sending non-ascii characters in headers when using `v4` signing.
